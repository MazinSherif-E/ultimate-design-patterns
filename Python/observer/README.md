### Some notes regarding the differences in code between Java and Python

## Method Overloading
- Unlike Java, In Python, you can't have the same function name with different parameters
- Because Python does not support method overloading by default. The reason for this is that Python functions are dynamically typed, and only the most recently defined function with the same name will be retained.
- But there's ways where you can achieve this in python

## Duck Typing
- Unlike Java, method parameters in Python do not have to be explicitly typed with their class, like ```product: Product```
- The variable product is expected to have a method get_name(). As long as the object passed into the function has a get_name() method, Python will execute it, regardless of whether the objectâ€™s type is explicitly defined or annotated.
