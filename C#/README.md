# C# Implementation

This is a C# implementation of the designs patterns presented in the [Ultimate Design Patterns](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-design-patterns/?referralCode=C4486750B8FA2ABC3F46) course, using common conventions and recommended practices in C#.

## File Structure

Each directory represents a design pattern. The entry point in each directory is `Program.cs`.

## Running the Code

### Pre-requisites

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/)
    > .NET can be installed from Visual Studio Installer

### Running the Code locally

All projects can be run in either of two ways:

1. Using Visual Studio 2022
    - Open the solution file `dotnet.sln` in Visual Studio
    - Right-click on the project you want to run and select `Set as StartUp Project`
    - Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the project, or `F5` to debug the project

2. Using the .NET CLI
    - Open a terminal in the project directory.
    - Run the command `dotnet run` to run the project.


## Contributing

Your code should follow the conventions and recommended practices in C#.

Any new design pattern should be added in a new directory, with the entry point being `Program.cs`.
