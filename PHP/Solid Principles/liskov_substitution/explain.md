### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subtypes should be substitutable for their
base types. In other words, if we have a base
class and a derived class, we should be able to
use the derived class wherever the base class
is expected without introducing any errors or
unexpected behaviors. This principle ensures
that the code is robust and works as intended.
