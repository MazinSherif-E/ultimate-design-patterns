### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Clients should not be forced to depend on
interfaces they do not use. This means that we
should break up interfaces into smaller, more
focused ones, to avoid coupling between
unrelated classes. This principle helps to keep
the code flexible and maintainable.
