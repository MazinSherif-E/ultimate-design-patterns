### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on
low-level modules. Instead, both should
depend on abstractions. This means that we
should depend on abstractions rather than
concrete implementations. This principle helps
to decouple modules, making them easier to
test, modify, and maintain.
